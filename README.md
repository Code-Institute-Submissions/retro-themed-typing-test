  ### Design Choices and Thoughts
  ---
  #### Fonts
  When deciding and choosing the font that I will use for the site I took the theme and idea I had in mind being retro and took inspiration from some font styles that was used in that 80s I have decided I will use a font which is an open source font called [Glass TTY VT](https://github.com/svofski/glasstty) I think this provides a retro theme and doesn't harm readability too much. If readability of text is an issue I plan to create a readability/accessibility switch so text can be transformed into an easier to read font.

  #### Colours
  To decide and chose which colours would suit my project I decided to use some inspiration from New York in the 80s at night where there was lots of vibrant colours and glowing accents I will try to create this theme throughout the website. To replicate the night feeling the website background will be dark using #131517 with a hint of #5C0000. To replicate vibrant glowing effects I will use text shadows and box shadows for glowing text throughout the site I will use colour #FF8585 with text shadow of #FF4D4D and #FB0000. Here are my colour choices:

  #### Page layout
  For my project I think I will go with a condensed layout inside containers I will use [Bootstrap](www.bootstrap.com "Bootstrap responsive framework") and the grid system to make the website responsive across devices as-well as using the short hand flexbox classes [Bootstrap](www.bootstrap.com "Bootstrap responsive framework") offers.

  ### Wireframes
